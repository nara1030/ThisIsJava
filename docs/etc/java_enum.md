## 개요

### 개념
> **Java enum**, also called Java **enumeration type**, is a type whose fields consist of a **fixed set of constants**.

* `Enumerations` are generally a set of **related** constants.
* Enumeration in Java is supported by keyword `enum`.
	* enums are a special type of class that always extends [java.lang.Enum](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/Enum.html).
* After JDK 1.4, Java designers decided to support it in Java also, and it was **officially released in JDK 1.5 release**.

### 배경
* The very purpose of enum is to **enforce compile time type safety**.
* We should use enum when we know all possible values of a variable at compile time or design time, though we can add more values in future as and when we identify them.
